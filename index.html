        <p> The 2022 FIFA World Cup is the 22nd FIFA World Cup, an international football tournament contested by the men's national teams of FIFA's member associations. It is taking place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022; it is the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan. France are the defending champions, having defeated Croatia 4â€“2 in the 2018 final. At an estimated cost of over $220 billion, it is the most expensive World Cup ever held; this figure is disputed by Qatari officials, including organizing CEO Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost is $8 billion, and other figures relate to overall infrastructure development since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010.</p>

To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate,[B] this World Cup is being held during November and December. It is being played in a reduced timeframe of 29 days with 64 matches to be played in eight venues across five cities. The Qatar national football team entered the event automatically, their first World Cup, alongside 31 teams who were determined by the qualification process. Qatar lost all three group matches; they became the first hosts to lose their opening game, the earliest host nation eliminated, and the second host (after South Africa in 2010) not to progress past the first stage. </p>
