        <p> The 2022 FIFA World Cup is the 22nd FIFA World Cup, an international football tournament contested by the men'  national teams of FIFA's member associations. The tournament features new substitution rules whereby teams may make up to five substitutions in normal time, and an additional substitution in extra time.[41][42][43] In addition, it is the first World Cup to feature concussion substitutions, whereby each team is permitted to use a maximum of one concussion substitute during a match. A concussion substitution does not count towards a team's quota of regular substitutions.[44] Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand suffered a concussion in his country's opening match against England and was replaced by Hossein Hosseini. This was the first use of a dedicated concussion substitute during a World Cup.</p>
